Use combination of adjusting partials individually and together as a harmonic
comb.
When each partial has been adjusted individually, they will probably not be
harmonically spaced (each partial will have a frequency that isn't an integer
multiple of the lowest partial). So to do the frequency update, the averaged
gradient could be applied by adding it multiplied by this non-integer value.
Maybe another way is possible.
Should the scalars adjusting the partials individually have larger scalars
("mu") the higher they are?
We need a way for the partial tracks to disappear / die at some point, perhaps using amplitude thresholding, or the non-convergence of the gradient.
